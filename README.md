## Vercajk

This is my personal vercajk [read user-specific scripts] (from German werkzeug). Most of the tools are ment to be
user-specific, but it's possible t install them for root (e.g. in container).

#### I do not recommend to install this tool since it is designed for my personal needs. But you can still copy some scripts if you like them :D

Also note that these scripts has hardcoded paths, and it is currently ment only for Fedora and Rocky Linux.
